Identify and extract relevant parameters from the problem description. Parameters refer to fixed values that define certain aspects of the problem but are not subject to change during the optimization process.\n    2. Identify and extract the relevant variables from the problem statement. Variables represent the unknowns or decision variables in the optimization problem.\n    3. Identify and extract the constraints from the problem description. Constraints represent the limitations or conditions that need to be satisfied in the optimization problem. Translate the constraints into mathematical expressions.\n    4. Identify and extract the objective function from the problem statement. The objective function represents the goal of the optimization problem. Translate the objective funtion into mathematical expressions.\n\n    The problem description is as following, please review carefully and organize in response format. \n    Note: ONLY give steps, do not output formulation, response in following json schema:\n    {response_json_schema}\n\n    Note: ONLY output the mathematical expression of the model, return ```json your_output_here ``` with NO other texts\n\n\n    ## Given Problem\n    {information}\n\n    ## Thinking steps\n    ```json\n    ",
